Please insert all the projects (which you decide to do) in a single solution and send the solution to us in a zip file.
Please pay attention to:
-	Readability: Try to make it easy and fast to read and understand the code
-	Performance: Try to use roughly the fastest solution that comes to mind
-	Documenting your choice. Why did you pick the approach you did?
-	Alternatives: Unless you clearly have the best solution please provide a couple of alternatives (code and/or comments) and explain why you prefer the chosen solution.
Please use C#, or if you’d like, you could use Swift or Kotlin. If you’d really prefer something else you may use Java. Or some other languages (e.g. Python or Lisp or Scheme). But you’d be working with C#...

Task #1
 FooBar
Print numbers 1-100 so that if the number can be divided by 3 print Foo (instead of the number); if it can be divided by 5 print Bar (instead of the number)

So something like
1
2
Foo
4
...

Task #2 Array of unique integers (live interview)
Create an array with unique numbers 1 - 100 000 in random order in it.
Clarification:
•	There should be a single (1) array created.
•	The single array should have 100 000 elements in it. Each element should be an integer between 1 to 100 000. Each integer should be there only once (e.g. they should be unique).
•	You don’t need to print out the array. I can just check it and the code using debugger.

Task #3 Layered console app with data access
Create a (.NET, Visual Studio) console app which has simple data and service layers and reads something and writes something to the database.
Pay attention to maintainability, DRY and keeping things simple
Task #4 Client-side search box
Create a simple (.NET, Visual Studio) web app (angularjs, angular or reactjs) where user can type something to a searchbox and gets results to the page from database.
Task #5 Client-side search box part 2
As continuation to the previous task, add an edit button where user can open a result, edit its contents, and save it back to database.
Task #6 Rearrange array
How to rearrange an array so that it starts from a specified element?
•	Array contains items “red”, “green”, “yellow”, “blue”, “purple”
•	We can start the array from yellow (instead of red), ending up with the following array:
“yellow”, “blue”, “purple”, “red”, “green”
